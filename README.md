## Search Bird - RestAPI
• RestAPI made using Flask to search for a bird using its power, habitat count and wingspan value <br />
• Can be run on http://localhost:5000/search-birds (to search for specific birds) and http://localhost:5000/birds (to get all the data for the birds)<br />
• Some combinations to try are listed in the Bird_combinations file<br />
• The Wingspan_Birds_data contains the birds data and is available as a reference and should be used when running the API <BR />
• Answer to the Question 5<br />
